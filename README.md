# Google-Ads-SEO-booster
# Automated Google Ads Link Navigator

This project is a Node.js script that automates the process of querying Google, selecting ad links relevant to the query, and navigating through those links with rotating proxies. Built using Puppeteer, it employs plugins for stealth and CAPTCHA handling, making it suitable for environments where detection avoidance is crucial.

## Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Utilizes `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` to reduce detection risk.
- **Automated Google Ads Interaction**: Fetches Google Ads links based on user-provided queries.
- **Rotating Proxies**: Ensures secure and undetected navigation across multiple links.
- **Flexible User Agent and Viewport**: Randomizes browser characteristics for realistic browsing behavior.
- **Link Storage and Revisit Options**: Saves visited links and allows reuse or revisit, ensuring efficient link management.
